# Supplier Research Report

**Introduction**

This report summarizes the findings of a research project aimed at evaluating several suppliers. The research methodology involved gathering data from three sources:  supplier websites, DomainAgeTool (for domain age assessment), and a custom TrustpilotTool (for Trustpilot rating retrieval).  While domain age data was successfully collected, the custom TrustpilotTool failed to return any Trustpilot ratings for the assessed suppliers.  This report will detail the findings from both data sources, noting the absence of Trustpilot data.


**Detailed Analysis**

The analysis below presents findings from the available data sources.  The lack of Trustpilot reviews prevents a comprehensive evaluation of customer satisfaction and sentiment.  Further investigation into alternative review platforms may be beneficial for a complete supplier assessment.  Error handling for missing Trustpilot data is implemented by displaying "N/A" in the relevant table column. Domain age, while providing some indication of supplier longevity, is not a sole indicator of reliability or quality.


| Supplier Name and Description | Main Website Link | Domain Age | Trustpilot Rating | Additional Metadata or Sitelinks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supplier A:  Example Supplier providing widgets | [https://www.examplea.com](https://www.examplea.com) | 12 years | N/A |  Social Media Links: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/examplea), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/examplea) |
| Supplier B: Another widget provider | [https://www.exampleb.com](https://www.exampleb.com) | Error | N/A |  |
| Supplier C:  Specializes in gizmos | [https://www.examplec.com](https://www.examplec.com) | 5 years | N/A |  Contact: examplec@email.com |
| Supplier D:  Provides high quality sprockets | [https://www.exampled.com](https://www.exampled.com) | N/A | N/A |  |


**Conclusion**

This report provides a preliminary assessment of several suppliers based on their website presence and domain age.  The absence of Trustpilot data limits the ability to assess customer satisfaction.  To obtain a more complete understanding of supplier performance, further investigation into customer reviews from alternative platforms (e.g., Google Reviews, Yelp) and potentially direct customer contact is recommended.  The "Error" and "N/A" entries highlight the challenges encountered in data collection, emphasizing the need for robust error handling and alternative data sources in future research efforts.  A reassessment with improved data acquisition methods is strongly suggested.
