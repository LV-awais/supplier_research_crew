## Insights, Trends, and Recommendations

* **Trustpilot data is inconsistent:** The presence and quality of Trustpilot reviews vary greatly across suppliers.  This underscores the need for diverse review sources.
* **Negative reviews prevalent:**  Some suppliers show significant negative sentiment on Trustpilot, highlighting the importance of proactive due diligence.
* **Domain Age is crucial:**  The age of a domain provides insights into the supplier's history and stability. This critical information is missing from this report and needs to be added.
* **Multiple data points necessary:**  Reliance on a single review source provides an incomplete picture.  A holistic approach combining Trustpilot, domain age, financial health, and direct engagement is recommended.


**Next Steps:**

1. Obtain domain age data for all suppliers.
2. Supplement Trustpilot reviews with data from alternative review sites and customer references.
3. Conduct a thorough financial health check for the suppliers under consideration.
