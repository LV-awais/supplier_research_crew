# Report: CustomApolloTool Error and Specifications

## Section 1: Error Encountered

While attempting to utilize the `CustomApolloTool`, the following error occurred:

* **Error Message:** Arguments validation failed: 1 validation error for CustomApolloToolSchema
  query
    Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value={'description': None, 'ty...domain': '29design.com'}, input_type=dict]
* **Error Code:**  string_type (Pydantic error)
* **Error URL:** https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/string_type


This error indicates that the input provided to the `query` argument was not a valid string.  The tool expected a string, but received a dictionary. The input value suggests an attempt to pass a dictionary containing a 'description' and potentially other keys, including 'domain'.


## Section 2: Tool Specifications

* **Tool Name:** CustomApolloTool
* **Tool Description:** Fetch organization data from Apollo API given a company URL or domain. The tool extracts the domain (e.g., domain.com from https://www.domain.com/xyz) and uses it to query the API.
* **Tool Arguments:**
    * `query`:  A string representing the query to send to the Apollo API.  The error suggests this should be a string containing a company URL or domain.  The current error stems from providing a dictionary instead of a string.

## Section 3: Potential Solutions and Recommendations

The root cause of the error is the incorrect data type provided to the `query` argument.  To resolve this:

1. **Correct Input Type:** Ensure that the input to the `query` parameter is a string. If using a variable, double-check its data type.  The input should be a simple string such as  `"29design.com"` or `"https://www.29design.com"`.

2. **Input Sanitization:** If the input comes from a user interface or another source, implement robust input validation and sanitization to ensure only strings are accepted.

3. **API Documentation:** Consult the Apollo API documentation to understand the expected format for queries and refine the string provided.


## Section 4:  Further Investigation

If the problem persists after correcting the data type, further debugging steps should be taken:

1. **Inspect the Input:** Print or log the exact value of the `query` argument before it is passed to the `CustomApolloTool` to verify it is a valid string.

2. **Review Tool Implementation:** Examine the `CustomApolloTool` code to ensure that it correctly handles the string input and extracts the domain before sending the query to the Apollo API.  There might be issues within the tool's logic in handling the input string.

3. **Apollo API Documentation:** Carefully review Apollo API documentation, paying close attention to the expected query parameters, data formats, and error responses to identify potential inconsistencies between the tool and the API itself.


This report provides a detailed analysis of the error and steps to resolve it.  By ensuring correct input and thoroughly investigating the tool's implementation and API interaction, the issue can likely be resolved.
