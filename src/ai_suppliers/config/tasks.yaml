    Based on the CombinedTool, for each supplier from search results, perform the following:
      1. Fetch the domain age for the supplier website.
         - Ensure the input URL is properly formatted.
         - If a lookup fails due to validation or API errors, record a placeholder ("Check Manually").
      2. Retrieve Trustpilot review data by searching for business reviews.
         - Extract the "og:title" and "AggregateRating" data.
         - If the information is unavailable, return "Check Manually".
      3. Fetch ZoomInfo company data:
         - Query for a ZoomInfo URL using the business name and scrape company details.
         - From the ZoomInfo response, extract key fields such as "name", "url", "foundingYear", "revenue", "address", and "contact number".
         - Additionally, extract email information from the "emailPatterns" field (specifically, the "sampleemail" value).
         - Include the email as both "contact_email" and as a separate "email" field in the output.
         - If any of the information is unavailable, record a placeholder ("Check Manually").
